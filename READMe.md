"learning basics in python OOP" 

Inheritance 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦: 
Just like humans inherit traits from their parents, classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes. This helps reduce code repetition and create a natural hierarchy in your code!

Example: Imagine a Vehicle class with general features (like wheels). We can create subclasses like Car and Bike that inherit those features


Polymorphism 🦄: 
Derived classes can behave differently for the same method inherited from a base class. With polymorphism, a method name can mean different things across multiple classes.

Example: Imagine a speak() method. Dogs bark(), while cats meow(), even though both use speak()!
